# BossaBox API Challenge

[PortuguÃªs](https://github.com/Matan18/bossaBoxAPIChallenge/blob/master/README.pt.md)

This is an API challenged by bossaBox for start on the site, is necessary to create a CRUD with dev tools, which will be created with title, link, description and tags properties.

## I will use:
* Express (NodeJS)
* TypeScrypt
* TypeORM
* PostgreSQL

Will try to use the SOLID principles, primarily to expand this project someday
